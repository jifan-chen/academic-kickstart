abstract = "Word pairs, which are one of the most easily accessible features between two text segments, have been proven to be very useful for detecting the discourse relations held between text segments. However, because of the data sparsity problem, the performance achieved by using word pair features is limited. In this paper, in order to overcome the data sparsity problem, we propose the use of word embeddings to replace the original words. Moreover, we adopt a gated relevance network to capture the semantic interaction between word pairs, and then aggregate those semantic interactions using a pooling layer to select the most informative interactions. Experimental results on Penn Discourse Tree Bank show that the proposed method without using manually designed features can achieve better performance on recognizing the discourse level relations in all of the relations."
