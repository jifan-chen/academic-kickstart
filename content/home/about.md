# Biography

Hi, I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Professor [Greg Durrett](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/). My main research interests lie within natural language processing. Specifically, I am interested in building robust and interpretable question answering systems. For example, [models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02610.pdf) producing discrete reasoning chains can be more effective and debuggable in the multi-hop QA setting. [Aligning the sub-parts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14648.pdf) of the question and the context can lead to better calibrated QA models, particularly in the adversarial setting. Using an entailment model as a [verifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08731.pdf) can help QA models generalize better across domains.  

Before coming to UT Austin, I finished my undergraduate study at [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). I also received a master degree from Fudan where I was advised by Professor [Xuanjing Huang](http://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/xjhuang/), [Qi Zhang](http://jkx.fudan.edu.cn/~qzhang/), and [Xipeng Qiu](http://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/xpqiu/en.html).
