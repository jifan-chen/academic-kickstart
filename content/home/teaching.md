- I was born and grown up in [Mengzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengzi_City), a very small town in the southwest of China where the famous dish [crossing-the-bridge noodles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing-the-bridge_noodles)(过桥米线) is originated.

- I started playing video games since I was a small kid. The first game I played is [The Legend of Sword and Fairy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Sword_and_Fairy)(仙剑奇侠传). I used to be a big fan of [Blizzard](https://www.blizzard.com/en-sg/) and played every single game they released. I had been playing [World of the Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft) for 13 years (2005 - 2018).
